Curve detectors in vision models have been hinted at in the literature as far back as 2013 (see figures in Zeiler & Fergus <d-cite bibtex-key=\"zeiler2014visualizing\"></d-cite>), and similar neurons have been studied carefully in neuroscience <d-cite bibtex-key=\"tang2018complex\"></d-cite>. We  <a href=\"https://distill.pub/2020/circuits/early-vision/#group_mixed3b_curves\">briefly discussed</a> curve in our earlier overview of early vision, but wanted to examine them in more depth. This article is the first part of a three article deep dive into curve detectors: their behavior, how they're built from earlier neurons, and their prevalence across models.</p>\n      <p>We're doing this because we believe that the interpretability community disagrees on several crucial questions. In particular, are neural network representations composed of meaningful features — that is, features tracking articulable properties of images? On the one hand, there are a number of papers reporting on seemingly meaningful features, such as eye detectors, head detectors, car detectors, and so forth <d-cite bibtex-key=\"mikolov2013distributed,karpathy2015visualizing,radford2017learning,zhou2014object,olah2017feature,netdissect2017\"></d-cite>. At the same time, there's a significant amount of skepticism, only partially reflected in the literature. One concern is that features which seem superficially to be meaningful may in fact not be what they appear <d-cite bibtex-key=\"donnelly2019interpretability\"></d-cite>. Several papers have suggested that neural networks primarily detect textures or imperceptible patterns<d-cite bibtex-key=\"jo2017measuring,geirhos2018imagenet,brendel2019approximating,ilyas2019adversarial\"></d-cite> rather than the kind of meaningful features described earlier. Finally, even if some meaningful features exist, it's possible they don't play an especially important role in the network<d-cite bibtex-key=\"morcos2018importance\"></d-cite>.  Some reconcile these results by concluding that if one observes, for example, what appears to be a dog head detector, it is actually a detector for special textures correlated with dog heads.</p>\n      <p>This disagreement really matters. If every neuron was meaningful, and their connections formed meaningful circuits, we believe it would open a path to completely reverse engineering and interpreting neural networks. Of course, we know not every neuron is meaningful, <d-footnote>As discussed in Zoom In, the main issue we see is what we call polysemantic neurons which respond to multiple different features, seemingly as a way to compress many features into a smaller number of neurons. We're hopeful this can be worked around.</d-footnote> but we think it's close enough for this path to be tractable. However, our position is definitely not the consensus view. Moreover, it seems too good to be true, and rings of the similar failed promises in other fields<d-footnote>For example, genetics seems to have been optimistic in the past that genes had individual functions and that the human genome project would allow us to “mine miracles,\" a position which now seems to be regarded as having been naive.</d-footnote> — skepticism is definitely warranted!</p>\n      <p>We believe that curve detectors are a good vehicle for making progress on this disagreement. Curve detectors seem like a modest step from edge-detecting Gabor filters, which the community widely agrees often form in the first convolutional layer. Furthermore, artificial curves are simple to generate, opening up lots of possibilities for rigorous investigation. And the fact that they're only a couple convolutional layers deep means we can follow every string of neurons back to the input. At the same time, the underlying algorithm the model has implemented for curve detection is quite sophisticated. If this paper persuades skeptics that at least curve detectors exist, that seems like a substantial step forward. Similarly, if it surfaces a more precise point of disagreement, that would also advance the dialogue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <H2 mdxType=\"H2\">A Simplified Story of Curve Neurons</H2>\n    <p>{`Before running detailed experiments, let's look at a high level and slightly simplified story of how the curve 10 neurons in 3b work.`}</p>\n\n    <CurvesFeatureVis mdxType=\"CurvesFeatureVis\" />\n    <p>{`Each curve detector implements a variant of the same algorithm: it responds to a wide variety of curves, preferring curves of a particular orientation and gradually firing less as the orientation changes.

We think part of the reason there is sometimes disagreement about whether neurons detect particular stimuli is that there are a variety of claims one may be making.

The objective we often use is to make the neuron fire as strongly as possible, but we'll use other objectives throughout in this article.

The most important thing to take away is the curve shape.

The quilt shows a pattern. Images that cause the strongest activations have curves that are similar to the neuron's feature visualization. Images that cause weakly positive activations are imperfect curves, either too flat, off-orientation, or with some other defect. Images that cause pre-ReLU activations near zero tend to be straight lines or images with no arcs, although some images are of curves about 45 degrees off orientation.

This seems to be at least partly due to labeling error and the rarity of curves (see discussion later). But it makes things a bit hard to reason about. This is why we haven't provided a precision-recall curve: recall would be dominated by the cases where the neuron didn't fire strongly and be dominated by potential labeling error as a result.`}</p>\n    <p>{`It's not clear that probability density is really the right way to think about the behavior of a neuron.

Contribution to expected value shows us that even by a conservative measure, curves and imperfect curves form 55%.

One way to get more insight into these questions is to draw our own curves. Using synthetic stimuli like this is a common method in visual neuroscience, and we've found it to also be very helpful in the study of artificial neural networks.

Perhaps this simplified environment could give us clues into how to make neurons more robust or even protect whole models against adversarial attacks.`}</p>\n    <p>{`In addition to testing orientation and curvature, we can also test other variants like whether the curve shapes are filled, or if they have color.

Another hypothesis is that a curve has higher \"contrast\" with perpendicular lines running towards. Recall that in the dataset examples, the strongest negative pre-ReLU activations were curves at opposite orientations. If a curve detector wants to see a strong change in orientation between the curve and the space around it, it may consider perpendicular lines to be more contrast than a solid color.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Finally, we think it's possible that combing is really just a convenient way to implement curve detectors — a side effect of a shortcut in circuit construction rather than an intrinsically useful feature. In conv2d1, edge detectors are inhibited by perpendicular lines in conv2d0. One of the things a line or curve detector needs to do is check that the image is not just a single repeating texture, but that it has a strong line surrounded by contrast. It seems to do this by weakly inhibiting parallel lines alongside the tangent. Being excited by a perpendicular line may be an easy way to implement a \"inhibit an excitatory neuron\" pattern which allows for capped inhibition, without creating dedicated neurons at the previous layer. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Combing is not unique to curves. We also observe it in lines, and basically any shape feature like curves that is derivative of lines. A lot more work could be done exploring the combing phenomenon. Why does combing form?
